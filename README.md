# scrape_cenbank_speech
This Python script utilizes the Selenium library to scrape information about speaker names, speech dates, speech titles, and speech URLs from [this website](https://www.centralbank.ie/news-media/speeches). Users are prompted to input a start date and end date, and the script returns the relevant information from the returned pages within that date range in a csv file.
